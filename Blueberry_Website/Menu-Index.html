        <h2> Planting your Blueberry Bush </h2>
        <p> Blueberries are ideally planted during spring <br> for best result.</p> 
        <ul class="plant-inst">
           <li>Before planting, select a spot that is far <br>away from any trees or buildings, that will <br> prevent any sunlight from reaching your plants.</li>
			     <li>It's important to understand the type of soil <br>your plants prefer, Blueberries well tolerate <br>acidic soil and thrive heavily once it's paired <br>with well drained soil. </li>
			     <li>Blueberries are often planted in multiple bushes, <br> space them 6 feet apart, and allow them to grow <br> individually.</li>
			     <li>Once your bush has settled, pour mulch over the <br> roots to conserve moisture, and prevent weed growth.</li>
			     <li>Water your bush up to 1 - 2” per week during <br> its growing season, and once it starts to ripen, <br>double the amount of water. </li>
